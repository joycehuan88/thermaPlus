            <h2>About ThermaPlus System</h2>
            <p>The ThermaPlus Wall System is a member of the Insulated Concrete Form (ICF) family. ICFs were initially developed in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. The technique continues to evolved rapidly with the use of modern foam plastics. During the last three decades, tens of thousands of ICF houses have been built in Europe and North America. Since its introduction into Australia in the 1980s, hundreds of ICF homes have been built here.</p>
            <p>The ThermPlus ICF Wall System varies significantly from the other ICF systems in such that the insulation foam is located only on one side. This creates a single-sided ICF wall system. The reasons for this is so that the can concrete provide an equal or greater amount of thermal mass as double brick walls and provides superior SIP panel like insulation which ultimately improves the wall thermal and comfort performance.  </p>


            <p>The development of the ThermaPlus Systems began in 2016. We set out to create a new wall system that can
                provide our clients with a solid, eco-friendly and luxurious wall system at an affordable price.</p>
            <p>Our mission is now to make this technology available for
                everyone who is considering building a new home. We will
                assist our client in every step of way towards the design
                and construction of their new home. We also offer our
                clients to find reputable builders and we ourselves can
                build the homes from the footings to the lock-down stage
                at a low fix price.</p>
            <p>We have over 16 years construction and building
                experience and want to make it as easy as possible for
                anyone to have solid comfortable homes.</p>
